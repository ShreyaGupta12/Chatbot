**Introduction**

Radioactive waste is a type of hazardous waste that contains radioactive material. It is a
byproduct from nuclear reactors, fuel processing plants, hospitals and research facilities.
Radioactive waste is also generated while decommissioning and dismantling nuclear reactors
and other nuclear facilities. There are two broad classifications: high-level or low-level waste.
High-level waste is primarily spent fuel removed from reactors after producing electricity.
Low-level waste comes from reactor operations and from medical, academic, industrial and
other commercial uses of radioactive materials.
The NRC regulates the storage and disposal of all commercially generated radioactive wastes
in the United States. The NRC also regulates high-level wastes generated by the Department of
Energy that are subject to long-term storage and not used for, or part of, research and
development activities. Regulations establish minimum acceptable performance criteria for
licensees managing wastes, while providing for flexibility in technological approach.

**Harmful Affects**

Although nuclear energy has proven to be very useful for us, the number of inherent risks
and dangers associated with negative effects of nuclear waste are serious beyond any
doubt.
Some of the reasons why it is dangerous are:
➢ There is no long-term storage solution
➢ It contaminates the environment
➢ It causes persistent negative health effects such as Gastrointestinal diseases,
Cardiovascular diseases, Diseases of the nervous system, Diabetes and Cancers
(lung, skin, breast, stomach and other) to name a few
➢ The waste cleanup is hazardous
➢ Reprocessing nuclear waste is harmful

● The Basic Principles of Radiation Protection

External contamination occurs when radioactive material, in the form of dust,
powder, or liquid, comes into contact with a person's skin, hair, or clothing. In other
words, the contact is external to a person's body. People who are externally
contaminated can become internally contaminated if radioactive material gets into
their bodies. Internal contamination occurs when people swallow or breathe in
radioactive materials, or when radioactive materials enter the body through an open
wound or are absorbed through the skin. Some types of radioactive materials stay in
the body and are deposited in different body organs. Other types are eliminated
from the body in blood, sweat, urine, and feces.
A person exposed to radiation is not necessarily contaminated with radioactive
material. A person who has been exposed to radiation has had radioactive waves or
particles penetrate the body, like having an x-ray. For a person to be contaminated,
radioactive material must be on or inside of his or her body. A contaminated person
is exposed to radiation released by the radioactive material on or inside the body.
An uncontaminated person can be exposed by being too close to radioactive
material or a contaminated person, place, or thing.
The use of universal precautions when handling human blood, human tissue, and
body fluids equally protect occupational workers from radioactive material
contamination. In general, the basic means of reducing your exposure to radiation
and keeping your exposure ALARA regardless of the specific source of radiation are
as follows:
➔ Keep the time of exposure to a minimum.
➔ Maintain distance from source.
➔ Where appropriate, place shielding between yourself and the source.
➔ Protect yourself against radioactive contamination.
➔ Protection against Radiation Exposure.

● Protection against Radiation Exposure

The radiation worker can control and limit his/her exposure to penetrating radiation
by taking advantage of time, distance, and shielding. By reducing the time of
exposure to a radiation source, the dose to the worker is reduced in direct
proportion with that time. The time directly influences the dose received: if you
minimize the time spent near the source, the dose received is minimized. The
exposure rate from a radiation source drops off by the inverse of the distance
squared. If a problem arises during a procedure, don't stand next to the source and
discuss your options with others present. Move away from the source or return it to
storage, if possible. The third exposure control is based on radiation shields,
automatic interlock devices, and in-place radiation monitoring instruments. Except
for temporary or portable shields, this type of control is usually built into the
particular facility.

● Introduction to Radiation Detectors

For those who work with or around radiation, one of the most important factors is
an awareness of the levels of radiation around them. This is primarily accomplished
through the use of radiation detectors of varying types. A basic understanding of
the different types of detectors out there and how they work can go a long way both
to finding the best detector for the required task and also for maximizing the
benefits of operating that detector.

**First Radiation Detectors**

Since the early days of radiation testing by Roentgen and Becquerel, scientists have
sought ways to measure and observe the radiation given off by the materials they
worked with. One of the earliest means of capturing any sort of data from
radioactivity was a photographic plate. A photographic plate would be placed in the
path/vicinity of a radioactive beam or material. When the plate was developed, it would have spots or be befogged from the exposure to radiation. Henri Becquerel
used a method similar to this to demonstrate the existence of radiation in 1896.
Another common early detector was the electroscope. These used a pair of gold
leaves that would become charged by the ionization caused by radiation and repel
each other. This provided a means of measuring radiation with a better level of
sensitivity than was reliably possible using photographic plates. Depending on the
arrangement of the device, they could be configured to measure alpha or beta
particles and were a valuable tool for early experiments involving radioactivity.
An interesting early device, borne out of a desire to measure the actual individual
particles or rays being emitted by a radioactive substance, as opposed to a more
gross measurement of a radioactive field, was the spinthariscope. Developed by
William Crookes, who had also invented the Crookes Tube used by Wilhelm
Roentgen to discover X-Rays, it used a zinc sulfide screen at the end of a tube, with a
lens at the other end, with a small amount of a radioactive substance near the zinc
sulfide screen. The zinc sulfide would react with the alpha particles emitted, and
each interaction would result in a tiny flash of light. This was one of the first means
of counting a rate of decay, albeit a very tedious one, as it meant scientists had to
work in shifts watching and literally counting the flashes of light. The spinthariscope
wasn’t very practical as a long-term solution for radiation detection, though it did
undergo a revival later in the 20th century as an educational tool. This tendency of
certain materials to give off light when exposed to radiation would also prove
valuable in future radiation detection technologies.
These early devices, and many others, such as cloud chambers, were valuable in
developing an understanding of the basic principles of radiation and conducting
important experiments that set the stage for later developments. This included the
development of new types of radiation detectors, many of which are still in use
today, such as G-M Tubes, Ion Chambers, and Scintillators.

Where/When you’d need a Radiation Detector

An important part of knowing what type of detector to use is to have an idea of how
and where it will be used. Different applications and settings call for different types
of detectors, as each detector type has various ways it can be specialized to fit a
role. The applications for radiation detection instruments can be broadly
categorized into a few different core tasks: measurement, protection, and search.
Radiation measurement tasks are for situations where there is a known presence of
radioactive materials which need to be monitored. The goal with this type of
detection is awareness. Awareness of the strength of an established radioactive
field, the boundaries of a radioactive area, or simply of the spread of radioactive
contamination. These are settings where the presence of radiation is expected, or at
least considered likely. The requirements for detectors involved in these settings are
unique, often with relatively higher measurement ranges or with modifications
needed to specifically look for one type of radiation.
Radiation protection is similar to radiation measurement applications in the sense
that it is usually in a setting where radiation is expected to be found. However, the
goals are different. With radiation measurement settings, the goal is to monitor the
radioactivity itself, to be aware of fluctuations, boundaries, etc. With radiation
protection, the goal is to monitor people. Radiation dosimetry is the most common
example of this, with radiation badges being worn by medical personnel, nuclear
industry workers, and many other occupationally exposed workers all over the
world. The importance of this is that it provides protection from the most harmful
effects of radiation exposure through awareness, in that a wearer can keep
informed of how much radiation they’ve been exposed to, and how that
corresponds to potential health effects, and alter their behavior or position or
schedule accordingly.
Radiation search differs from the other two basic categories of radiation detection
applications in that it is predicated both on the fact that radiation is not expected in
the area and the desire to keep things that way. Primarily the goal of radiation
security personnel, first responders, or groups such as customs & border
inspectors, radiation search has a different set of requirements to mirror the
significantly different circumstances in which it takes place. Detectors need to be
highly sensitive, with the concern being more about smaller, concealed radioactive
sources or materials. Spectroscopy is often very helpful as well, since it is typically a small subset of radioactive isotopes that are of concern, and being able to filter
those out that are present due to legitimate reasons such as medical treatment or
just an accumulation of a naturally occurring radioactive substance is important.

**The Objective of the Project**

The purpose of this project is to develop an approach for a radiation detection device using
the Design Thinking Process. By applying our technical knowledge and exposing ourselves
through extensive research, we aim to ideate solutions for a real-world problem. i.e,
radiation exposure and detection.

**Implementation**

Implementation is the realization of an application, or execution of a plan, idea, model,
design, specification, standard, algorithm, or policy.

**What?** During the empathize phase, you’ll engage with and observe your target audience. In our case, the workers, general audience, and other people in the regions where radioactive waste/ plants are present.

**Why?** The aim of this step is to paint a clear picture of who your end users are, what challenges they face, and what needs and expectations must be met. A number of accidents have happened over the years (information taken from Wikipedia) wherein the people living in the target place have faced consequences.

At the most basic level, a chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation (either written or spoken), allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a real person.

NLP:

NLP is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.
